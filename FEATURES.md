# IoT Connect - Features & IT/OT Communication Guide

## How IT/OT Communication is Improved

This application bridges the gap between Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) teams through several key features:

### 1. **Unified Interface for All Stakeholders**

**Problem Solved:** OT users previously had to use Git, YAML files, and command-line tools that they weren't comfortable with.

**Solution:**
- **OT Users** can use the visual wizard to configure machines without touching code
- **IT Users** can still see the underlying configuration and access advanced settings
- **Both teams** work in the same system, eliminating miscommunication

### 2. **Visual Configuration Management**

**OT Benefits:**
- No YAML editing required
- Visual forms for all machine parameters
- Protocol selection with clear descriptions
- Device auto-discovery (browse device tree)
- Template library for common setups

**IT Benefits:**
- Full CRUD operations on all machines
- View raw configuration details
- Git sync status visible
- Access to connection testing and troubleshooting tools

### 3. **Shared Visibility**

**Communication Improvements:**
- **Dashboard** shows real-time status of all machines - both teams see the same data
- **Machine Detail pages** provide complete information accessible to everyone
- **Deployment logs** are visible during and after deployment - transparency for debugging
- **Status indicators** immediately show connection health

### 4. **Role-Appropriate Features**

**OT User Flow:**
1. Click "Add New Machine"
2. Fill simple wizard with machine details
3. Browse device for data points (no manual typing)
4. Deploy with one click
5. Monitor status from dashboard

**IT User Flow:**
1. Can do everything OT users can
2. Additionally: Edit any machine configuration
3. Test connections manually
4. View detailed protocol parameters
5. Access Git repository information
6. Troubleshoot using connection logs

### 5. **Elimination of Manual Hand-offs**

**Before:** OT team emails machine specs → IT team manually creates YAML → Back-and-forth for corrections

**After:** OT team configures machine in UI → Configuration automatically validated → Deployment automated → Both teams see same status

### 6. **Documentation in Context**

- AI Assistant provides protocol-specific help
- Tooltips and descriptions explain technical terms
- Templates serve as working examples
- Machine detail pages act as living documentation

## Complete CRUD Functionality

### Create (Add New Machine)

  - 5-step wizard with validation
  - Protocol selection (OPC UA, S7, Modbus, MQTT, Custom)
  - Dynamic forms based on protocol
  - Device browsing for auto-discovery
  - Connection testing before deployment
  - Deployment progress tracking

### Read (View Machines)
- **Dashboard View:** Card-based layout with key metrics
- **List View:** Searchable table with all machines
- **Detail View:** Complete machine information including:
  - Status and metadata
  - Connection details
  - All data points
  - Protocol configuration

### Update (Edit Machine)
- **Location:** Machine Detail → "Edit" button
- **Features:**
  - Edit all basic information
  - Add/remove/modify data points
  - Inline table editing for data points
  - Validation before saving
  - Preserves protocol configuration

### Delete (Remove Machine)
- **Location:** Machine Detail → "Delete" button
- **Features:**
  - Confirmation modal with warning
  - Permanent removal from system
  - Prevents accidental deletion

## Additional CRUD Operations

### Machine Status Control
- **Connect/Disconnect:** Toggle machine connection status
- **Test Connection:** Verify connectivity on demand
- **Deployment:** Re-deploy machine configuration

### Data Point Management
- Add individual data points
- Bulk import from files
- Browse device for auto-discovery
- Inline editing in tables
- Delete individual data points

## Search & Filter
- Search machines by name or location
- Filter by protocol type
- Filter by status (connected, disconnected, etc.)
- Sort by any column in table view

## Template System
- Browse 6 pre-built templates
- Use template to pre-fill wizard
- Templates serve as documentation
- Filter templates by protocol or industry

## Real-time Features
- Live status updates
- Deployment progress tracking
- Connection health monitoring
- Git sync status indicator

## IT/OT Collaboration Workflows

### Scenario 1: New Machine Installation
1. **OT Engineer** (on factory floor):
   - Opens IoT Connect on tablet
   - Uses "Add New Machine" wizard
   - Browses device to discover data points
   - Tests connection → success
   - Deploys configuration

2. **IT Engineer** (remote):
   - Sees new machine appear on dashboard
   - Reviews configuration in detail view
   - Verifies Git commit was created
   - Monitors deployment progress
   - No email or Slack messages needed!

### Scenario 2: Troubleshooting Connection Issue
1. **OT Engineer** reports issue via dashboard status
2. **IT Engineer** opens machine detail page
3. Views connection parameters and recent logs
4. Tests connection to diagnose
5. Edits configuration if needed
6. OT Engineer sees updated status immediately

### Scenario 3: Standardizing Configuration
1. **IT Engineer** creates template from working machine
2. Adds to template library with documentation
3. **OT Engineers** use template for new installations
4. Consistency ensured, errors reduced

## Benefits Summary

| Benefit | OT Users | IT Users | Both |
|---------|----------|----------|------|
| No code/YAML editing | ✅ | | |
| Visual forms | ✅ | | |
| Full system control | | ✅ | |
| Git integration visibility | | ✅ | |
| Real-time status | | | ✅ |
| Shared dashboard | | | ✅ |
| Faster deployment | | | ✅ |
| Reduced errors | | | ✅ |
| Better communication | | | ✅ |

## Technical Implementation

All CRUD operations update the Zustand store immediately, providing:
- **Optimistic UI updates** - Changes appear instantly
- **Type-safe operations** - TypeScript prevents errors
- **Consistent state** - Single source of truth
- **Audit trail** - Last updated timestamps on all changes

The application simulates backend operations but is architected to easily connect to real APIs when ready.
